# 🎉 Almost Done! Final Step

## ✅ What's Working:
- ✅ Camera stream is running on Raspberry Pi
- ✅ ngrok tunnel is active
- ✅ Your ngrok URL: `https://superexacting-proficiently-parthenia.ngrok-free.dev`

## 🚀 Final Step: Set Railway Environment Variable

### In your Railway dashboard:

1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on your service
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Click **New Variable**
5. Add:
   - **Name:** `RASPBERRY_PI_URL`
   - **Value:** `https://superexacting-proficiently-parthenia.ngrok-free.dev/stream.mjpg`

6. Click **Add** and Railway will automatically redeploy!

### Or use Railway CLI (if installed):

```bash
railway variables set RASPBERRY_PI_URL="https://superexacting-proficiently-parthenia.ngrok-free.dev/stream.mjpg"
railway up
```

## 🎯 Expected Result:

After Railway redeploys (2-3 minutes), visit your Railway URL and you'll see:
- ✅ Live camera feed
- ✅ YOLO object detection with bounding boxes
- ✅ Status badge showing "LIVE" in green

## 📝 Important Notes:

- **ngrok URL is now active** and will work until you stop it
- Free ngrok tunnels don't expire anymore (they changed their policy)
- Camera and ngrok are running in background on your Pi
- No keyboard/mouse/screen needed - everything is remote! 🎉

## 🔧 Management Commands:

**Check status:**
```bash
ssh admn@192.168.4.102 "ps aux | grep -E '(camera_stream|ngrok)' | grep -v grep"
```

**Restart everything:**
```bash
ssh admn@192.168.4.102 "pkill -f camera_stream; pkill ngrok; nohup python3 ~/camera_stream.py > ~/camera.log 2>&1 & nohup ngrok http 8000 > /dev/null 2>&1 &"
```

**Get ngrok URL again:**
```bash
ssh admn@192.168.4.102 "curl -s http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels" | grep -o '"public_url":"https://[^"]*' | cut -d'"' -f4
```

**You're all set! Just add that variable in Railway and you're done!** 🚀
