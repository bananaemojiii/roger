# ðŸ”§ ngrok Free Tier Limitation

## Problem
ngrok's free tier (as of 2024) shows a mandatory browser warning page that cannot be bypassed with headers, breaking automated API access.

## âœ… Solutions

### Option 1: Use ngrok Agent API (Best for now)
Instead of accessing the public URL directly, we can create a local proxy on the Pi that fetches from localhost.

### Option 2: Upgrade ngrok Plan ($8/month)
- No browser warning
- Static domains
- More reliable
- Recommended for production

### Option 3: Use Cloudflare Tunnel (Free Alternative)
Cloudflare Tunnel doesn't have browser warnings and is free!

Let me implement Option 3 (Cloudflare Tunnel) as it's free and more reliable!
