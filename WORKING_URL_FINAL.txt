üöÄ FINAL STEP - Update Railway:

2. Click Variables tab
3. Set: RASPBERRY_PI_URL=https://bundle-payday-nelson-dim.trycloudflare.com/stream.mjpg
4. Save (auto-redeploys)
5. Wait 2-3 minutes
6. Visit: roger-production-478d.up.railway.app

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES:

Current Setup (Works but temporary):
- WiFi connection (consider Ethernet for stability)
- Cloudflare Quick Tunnel (URL changes on restart)
- Good for testing, not ideal for production

For Long-term/Production:
1. Connect Pi via Ethernet cable (more stable)
2. Choose permanent solution:
   - Router Port Forwarding (free, most stable)
   - ngrok Paid $8/mo (easy, reliable)
   - Cloudflare Permanent Tunnel (free, moderate setup)
