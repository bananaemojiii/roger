# 🚀 Final Railway Setup with Hugging Face

## ✅ What's Done:

1. ✅ YOLO model uploaded to Hugging Face
2. ✅ app.py updated to use HF model
3. ✅ requirements.txt updated
4. ✅ Changes committed to git

## 🌐 Your Hugging Face Model:

https://huggingface.co/bananafactories/yolov8-camera-model

## 📝 Railway Environment Variables to Set:

Go to Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Variables tab and add:

```
RASPBERRY_PI_URL=https://bundle-payday-nelson-dim.trycloudflare.com/stream.mjpg
HUGGINGFACE_REPO=your-username/your-repo-name
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your-hf-token-here
```

## 🚀 Deploy to Railway:

### If using Railway CLI:
```bash
railway up
```

### If using GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```
Railway will auto-deploy!

### If using Railway Dashboard:
- Go to Deployments tab
- Click "Trigger Deploy"

## ⏱️ First Deployment Timeline:

1. **Building** (2-3 min)
   - Installing Python packages
   - Including huggingface_hub

2. **Starting** (1-2 min)
   - Downloading model from HF (6MB)
   - Loading YOLO
   - Connecting to camera stream

3. **Total**: ~5 minutes first time
4. **Subsequent deploys**: ~2-3 minutes (model cached)

## ✅ After Deployment:

Visit: `https://roger-production-478d.up.railway.app`

You should see:
- ✅ Live camera feed
- ✅ YOLO object detection with bounding boxes
- ✅ Status badge showing "LIVE" in green

## 🎯 Benefits of HF Storage:

✅ **Easy Updates**: Upload new model to HF, Railway auto-downloads
✅ **Version Control**: Track model versions on HF
✅ **Free Storage**: No cost for hosting models
✅ **Model Cards**: Document your custom models
✅ **Sharing**: Share models across projects

## 🔄 To Update Model Later:

```python
# From your local machine (in venv):
from huggingface_hub import HfApi
api = HfApi()

# Upload new model
api.upload_file(
    path_or_fileobj="path/to/new_model.pt",
    path_in_repo="yolov8n.pt",
    repo_id="your-username/your-repo-name",
    token="your-hf-token-here",
    commit_message="Update to custom trained model"
)

# Then in Railway, just trigger redeploy!
# It will download the new model automatically
```

## 📊 Current Architecture:

```
Raspberry Pi Camera
    ↓ (video stream)
Cloudflare Tunnel
    ↓ (public HTTPS)
Railway Server
    ├─ Downloads model from: Hugging Face
    ├─ Processes frames with: YOLO
    └─ Serves to: User's Browser
```
