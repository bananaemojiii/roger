# ðŸ”§ Fixed ngrok Connection Issue!

## âœ… What I Fixed:
Added special headers to bypass ngrok's browser warning page:
- `ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true`
- User-Agent header
- Increased timeout to 10 seconds

## ðŸš€ Deploy This Fix:

### Option 1: Using Railway Dashboard
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on **Deployments** tab
3. Click **Deploy** or **Redeploy**
4. Railway will pull the latest commit and deploy

### Option 2: Using Railway CLI
```bash
railway up
```

### Option 3: Push to GitHub (if connected)
```bash
git push origin main
```
Railway will auto-deploy!

### Option 4: Manual deployment trigger
Go to Railway dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Trigger Deploy

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result:
After redeployment (2-3 minutes):
- âœ… Video stream will load
- âœ… YOLO detection will work
- âœ… Status badge shows "LIVE" in green
- âœ… No more SSL errors!

## ðŸ“Š Verify It's Working:
1. Wait for Railway deployment to complete
2. Visit your Railway URL
3. You should see the live camera feed with YOLO bounding boxes!

**The fix is committed and ready to deploy!** ðŸŽ‰

Just trigger a redeploy in Railway and you're done!
